twc-healthdata
==============

This repository contains the key technology components for the Linked Data aggregation site http://healthdata.tw.rpi.edu.

We are using tools from RPI, csv2rdf4lod, LODspeakr, DataFAQs, and others, to set up an infrastructure and process for providing high-quality data and metadata conversions into linked data. Our web site, http://healthdata.tw.rpi.edu, is driven by a github project, and we are actively accepting and creating conversion enhancement metadata through the github code contribution process. We are accepting new datasets directly through the CKAN web interface.
